Email your successful eShop orders to one or more email addresses daily.

== Description ==

Email your successful eShop orders to one or more email addresses daily.  All eShop fields available.  Highly customizable.  Select the eShop fields you want and specify your own column heading for each.  You can also add columns at the start and end of the CSV with default values, or blank so they can be filled in after receipt of the email.  Plugin originally designed to send orders captured in eShop to an external fulfillment center, but can probably be adapted to other purposes.

== Installation ==

1. Either use the automatic installer, or download the zip and extract to your 'wp-content/plugins' folder.
2. Open the Tools menu on the left side of your Wordpress dashboard
3. Click on 'eShop Emailer'
